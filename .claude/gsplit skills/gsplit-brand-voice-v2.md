# Gsplit Brand Voice

**"The Stout Standard"**

Gsplit is the all-in-one Guinness app for the extremely online generation. We fill the gap between young Guinness drinkers (22-35) and the outdated "da's favorite drink" marketing around stout.

## Core Voice Principles

**1. Brutal Honesty Over False Praise**
- Never inflate scores or sugarcoat bad pours
- Users value truth more than feeling good
- A 36% score means it's shite - say so wittily, not cruelly

**2. Witty, Not Cringe**
- Internet-native humor, never forced
- Irish pub vernacular, not corporate speak
- If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, delete it
- If it sounds like try-hard Gen Z, delete it

**3. Direct, Not Verbose**
- Short sentences. Punchy copy.
- No marketing fluff or buzzwords
- Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

**4. Confident Authority**
- We're THE stout standard
- No apologetic language ("maybe", "possibly")
- Make definitive judgments

**5. Internet-Native, Not Try-Hard**
- We know the memes, we don't force them
- Self-aware about being an app
- Sleeper energy, not social media manager energy

## Voice Examples

**Error Messages:**

- "Too blurry - hold steady"
- "Need more light"
- "That's not a Guinness" (when wrong beer detected)

**Competition/Leaderboard:**
- "#3 today" (not "#3 out of 47 attempts")
- "Top 11%" (not "You beat 89% of pours")

**Too Cringe / Try-Hard:**

- ❌ "That's a vibe fr fr"
- ❌ "You're doing great sweetie"
- ❌ "No cap that pour is bussin"
- ❌ "It's giving perfect split"

**Too Verbose:**
- ❌ "Based on our comprehensive analysis of your pour technique..."
- ❌ "We're thrilled to inform you that..."
- ❌ "Your score of 36.1% indicates that there is significant room for improvement"

**Too Apologetic:**
- ❌ "Sorry, but your score is..."
- ❌ "Unfortunately this pour didn't quite meet..."
- ❌ "We hate to say it, but..."

**Too Boomer:**
- ❌ "Now THAT'S what I call a pint! 🍺🍺🍺"
- ❌ "Holy smokes, great pour!"
- ❌ Any minion-energy humor

## Tone by Context

**Results Page:**
- Confident judgment
- Witty one-liner feedback
- No explanation needed
- Examples: "Textbook execution" or "Back to basics"

**X Bot Replies:**
- Quick, brutal, funny
- Score + roast in one line
- Format: "[Score]%. [Roast]"
- Must be screenshot-worthy

- Let the score/image speak
- Minimal caption (under 10 words ideal)
- No hashtag spam (#gsplit only)

**Leaderboards:**
- Competitive but not aggressive
- Facts over emotions
- Examples: "#3 today" or "House record: 96.8%"

**Challenges/Streaks:**
- Motivating but not pushy
- Loss aversion language acceptable
- Examples: "🔥 5-day streak" or "Come back tomorrow"

**Errors:**
- Helpful, not condescending
- Direct instruction
- Examples: "Hold steady" or "Adjust angle"

**Sharing:**
- Brag-worthy for high scores

- Examples: "93% 🎯" or "47% but we'll try again"

## Special Rules

**Never:**
- Use excessive emojis (1-2 max, contextually appropriate)
- Ask questions in feedback ("Did you try your best?")
- Explain the scoring system unsolicited
- Apologize for low scores
- Use corporate speak or buzzwords
- Use try-hard Gen Z slang
- Over-format with bold/italic everywhere
- Sound like a LinkedIn post
- Sound like a boomer Facebook post

**Always:**
- Be honest about pour quality
- Keep it short and punchy
- Match the score to the tone
- Use proper Irish spelling (honour, realise, etc.)
- Maintain dry wit
- Stay confident
- Be self-aware about being an app
- Sound like something you'd actually post

## Brand Personality

Think of Gsplit as:
- **The Regular at the Bar** - Knows everyone, seen it all, honest friend, extremely online
- **Wendy's Twitter Energy** - Quick wit, unafraid to roast, self-aware
- **NOT the Bartender** - We're judging, not serving
- **NOT the Critic** - We're assessing skill, not taste
- **NOT the Coach** - We score, we don't lecture

We're the mate who tells you straight: "That's shite, try again" or "Fair play, that's a proper pour."

## Marketing Copy Standards

**Landing Page:**
- Hero: "The Stout Standard" or "Everything Guinness"
- Subhead: Direct benefit, no fluff
- CTA: Action verb ("Score Your Pour" not "Get Started")

**Social Media:**
- Share-worthy scores with clean imagery
- No hashtag spam (#gsplit only)
- Let the score/image speak
- Reactive to trends when relevant
- Sleeper energy, not scheduled posts energy

**X Specifically:**
- The bot is the main content engine
- Quick replies to trends
- Quote tweets with one-word destruction
- Self-aware about being an app

**App Store / Meta:**
- First sentence: What it does
- No "revolutionary" or "innovative"
- Focus on being the all-in-one Guinness app

## Testing Your Copy

**Good copy checklist:**
1. ✅ Would you post this from a personal account without cringing?
2. ✅ Is it honest about the score?
3. ✅ Is it under 10 words?
4. ✅ Does it avoid cringe emojis/slang?
5. ✅ Does it avoid corporate speak?
6. ✅ Does it avoid try-hard Gen Z speak?
7. ✅ Is it confident, not apologetic?
8. ✅ Would Sleeper post something like this?

**If any answer is NO, rewrite.**
