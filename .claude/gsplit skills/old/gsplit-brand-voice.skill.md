# GSplit Brand Voice

GSplit is "The Digital Barman" - confident, direct, honest about pour quality with witty Irish pub banter.

## Core Voice Principles

**1. Brutal Honesty Over False Praise**
- Never inflate scores or sugarcoat bad pours
- Users value truth more than feeling good
- A 36% score means it's shite - say so wittily, not cruelly

**2. Witty, Not Cringe**
- Internet-native humor, never forced
- Irish pub vernacular, not corporate speak
- If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, delete it

**3. Direct, Not Verbose**
- Short sentences. Punchy copy.
- No marketing fluff or buzzwords
- Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

**4. Confident Authority**
- We're THE authority on G-splits
- No apologetic language ("maybe", "possibly")
- Make definitive judgments

## Voice Examples

### ✅ GOOD Examples

**Score Feedback (High Scores 85%+):**
- "Perfect split. Absolute cinema."
- "Now that's a pour."
- "Textbook execution."
- "Chef's kiss 👨‍🍳"
- "That'll do nicely."

**Score Feedback (Mid Scores 60-85%):**
- "Not bad for a Tuesday."
- "Getting there."
- "Room for improvement, but respectable."
- "Solid effort."
- "You've poured worse."

**Score Feedback (Low Scores <60%):**
- "Back to basics."
- "Maybe next time."
- "That's certainly a choice."
- "Practice makes perfect."
- "We've seen worse. Not many, but some."

**CTAs:**
- "Try Again" (not "Retry")
- "Rate Your Guinness" (not "Rate Your Pour")
- "Share Your Score" (not "Share Your Results")
- "Settle It" (competitive context)

**Error Messages:**
- "Can't see the harp logo - adjust your angle"
- "Too blurry - hold steady"
- "Need more light"
- "That's not a Guinness" (when wrong beer detected)

**Competition/Leaderboard:**
- "#3 today" (not "#3 out of 47 attempts")
- "Top 11%" (not "You beat 89% of pours")
- "Better than most"
- "House record: 96.8%"

### ❌ BAD Examples

**Too Corporate:**
- ❌ "Congratulations on your achievement!"
- ❌ "Thank you for using our platform"
- ❌ "Your journey to perfect pours starts here"
- ❌ "Unlock your potential"

**Too Cringe:**
- ❌ "OMG amazing!!! 🎉🎉🎉"
- ❌ "Slay queen! 💅"
- ❌ "That's a vibe fr fr"
- ❌ "You're doing great sweetie"

**Too Verbose:**
- ❌ "Based on our comprehensive analysis of your pour technique..."
- ❌ "We're thrilled to inform you that..."
- ❌ "Your score of 36.1% indicates that there is significant room for improvement in your pouring methodology"

**Too Apologetic:**
- ❌ "Sorry, but your score is..."
- ❌ "Unfortunately this pour didn't quite meet..."
- ❌ "We hate to say it, but..."

**Wrong Terminology:**
- ❌ "G-Split" (it's GSplit, no hyphen)
- ❌ "Beat 89% of pours" (never use "pours" for people)
- ❌ "That's a pour" (unless genuinely positive context)

## Word Choices

**✅ USE:**
- Guinness (full brand name)
- GSplit (no hyphen)
- Split / G-split (the act)
- Pint
- Pour (as verb or when genuinely good)
- Attempt
- Score
- Barman / Bar staff
- Pub
- The harp (logo)
- Settle it

**❌ AVOID:**
- Guiness (misspelling)
- G-Split (hyphenated)
- Beverage
- Drink
- Consumer
- User experience
- Journey
- Ecosystem
- Leverage
- Synergy
- Optimize
- "Pours" (when referring to people/attempts)

## Tone by Context

**Results Page:**
- Confident judgment
- Witty one-liner feedback
- No explanation needed
- Examples: "Textbook execution" or "Back to basics"

**Leaderboards:**
- Competitive but not aggressive
- Facts over emotions
- Examples: "#3 today" or "House record: 96.8%"

**Challenges/Streaks:**
- Motivating but not pushy
- Loss aversion language acceptable
- Examples: "🔥 5-day streak" or "Come back tomorrow"

**Errors:**
- Helpful, not condescending
- Direct instruction
- Examples: "Hold steady" or "Adjust angle"

**Sharing:**
- Brag-worthy for high scores
- Self-deprecating humor for low scores
- Examples: "I scored 87% at Temple Bar 🍺" or "36% but we'll try again"

## Special Rules

**Never:**
- Use excessive emojis (1-2 max, contextually appropriate)
- Ask questions in feedback ("Did you try your best?")
- Explain the scoring system unsolicited
- Apologize for low scores
- Use corporate speak or buzzwords
- Over-format with bold/italic everywhere

**Always:**
- Be honest about pour quality
- Keep it short and punchy
- Match the score to the tone
- Use proper Irish spelling (honour, realise, etc.)
- Maintain dry wit
- Stay confident

## Feedback Generation Formula

**For AI-generated feedback (when using Anthropic API):**

Prompt structure:
```
Generate witty one-line feedback for a Guinness pour that scored [SCORE]%.

Guidelines:
- Irish pub vernacular
- Brutally honest but not mean
- 5-8 words max
- Dry wit, no cringe
- Match tone to score:
  * 85%+: Confident praise
  * 60-85%: Constructive but positive
  * <60%: Honest but not harsh

Examples of good feedback:
- 95%: "Perfect split. Absolute cinema."
- 72%: "Not bad for a Tuesday."
- 38%: "Back to basics."

Generate ONE line only.
```

## Brand Personality

Think of GSplit as:
- **The Regular at the Bar** - Knows everyone, seen it all, honest friend
- **NOT the Bartender** - We're judging, not serving
- **NOT the Critic** - We're assessing skill, not taste
- **NOT the Coach** - We score, we don't teach (yet)

We're the mate who tells you straight: "That's shite, try again" or "Fair play, that's a proper pour."

## Marketing Copy Standards

**Landing Page:**
- Hero: "Settle the Split" or "The Official G-Split Score"
- Subhead: Direct benefit, no fluff
- CTA: Action verb ("Score Your Pour" not "Get Started")

**Social Media:**
- Share-worthy scores with clean imagery
- No hashtag spam (#gsplit only)
- Let the score/image speak

**App Store / Meta:**
- First sentence: What it does
- No "revolutionary" or "innovative"
- Focus on settling pub debates

## Testing Your Copy

**Good copy checklist:**
1. ✅ Would you say this in a pub?
2. ✅ Is it honest about the score?
3. ✅ Is it under 10 words?
4. ✅ Does it avoid cringe emojis/slang?
5. ✅ Is it confident, not apologetic?

**If any answer is NO, rewrite.**
