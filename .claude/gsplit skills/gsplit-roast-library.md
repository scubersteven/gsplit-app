## AI Wildcard Guidelines (20% of responses)

When generating original roasts:
- Match the tier's energy level
- Irish pub vernacular
- No periods at end of lines
- Emojis only when they add something (1 max)
- No try-hard Gen Z slang (no "fr fr", "no cap", "it's giving", "slay")
- No boomer energy
- Ma/da jokes welcome in lower tiers
- Dry wit > loud humor
- Short (under 10 words ideal)
